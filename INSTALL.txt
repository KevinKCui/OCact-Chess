Install Instructions:

Our current version requires ANSITerminal

Please update OPAM before installing:
command: opam update

This first command may take a while, but that is normal.
Next, you may have to upgrade already-installed packages
You can do so with the following command:
command: opam upgrade

Finally, you can install ANSITerminal.
command: opam install ANSITerminal

That should be all the installations you will need!
