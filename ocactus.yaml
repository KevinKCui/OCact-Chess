# Write a short, attention-grabbing description of your project.
desc: >
  Our project is a graphical user interface for chess. It supports 
  all the standard rules of chess including en-passant, castling, and pawn
  promotion. The interface is click and click (or optionally based on user 
  input with traditional chess notation), and the GUI is designed to both be 
  aesthetically pleasing and smooth running.
