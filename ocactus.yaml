# Write a short, attention-grabbing description of your project.
desc: >
  Our project is a graphical user interface for chess. It supports 
  all the standard rules of chess including en-passant, castling, and pawn
  promotion. The interface is through the terminal. Users move a piece [p] by entering
  the square [p] is on and then the square they want to move [p] to. Our game
  disallows illegal moves and identifies when a game ends in stalemate or checkmate.
